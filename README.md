# Machine Learning Challenge

## Overview

This challenge involves analyzing network traffic data and developing a machine learning model to distinguish between benign and malicious traffic. The dataset provided consists of Zeek log files extracted from a packet capture of a Remote Access Trojan (RAT) running on an infected mobile phone.

## Challenge Goal

- **Objective**: Provide Python scripts and/or a Jupyter notebook that includes data analysis and a machine learning model trained on the given network traffic dataset. The model should effectively separate malware traffic from normal traffic.

## Dataset Description

- **Content**: The dataset comprises a directory of Zeek log files containing both benign and malicious traffic.
- **Labeling Information**: The dataset is unlabeled, but it is known that the first 4 minutes of the traffic are benign. This information can be used to label the traffic and train the model.

## Expected Outcome

Participants are expected to develop a machine learning model capable of:

1. **Preprocessing the Data**: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for model training, including any necessary feature extraction or engineering.
2. **Labeling the Data**: Using the provided information to label the traffic as benign or malicious.
3. **Model Training**: Implementing and training a machine learning model on the labeled dataset.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance in distinguishing between benign and malicious traffic.

The challenge is designed to evaluate the participant's approach to creating a machine learning pipeline, including goal setting, data processing, model selection, and evaluation.
